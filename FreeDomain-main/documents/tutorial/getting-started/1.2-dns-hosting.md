# DNS Hosting

After registering your DigitalPlat account, the next step is choosing a DNS hosting provider.

DigitalPlat works with **any standard DNS provider**, but for beginners, we strongly recommend **Cloudflare**. It’s free, reliable, fast, and easy to use.

This guide walks you through setting up DNS hosting with Cloudflare.

## Why Cloudflare?

Cloudflare is a popular DNS and security platform trusted by millions of websites worldwide.

It’s a good choice because:

- Free plan is enough for most users
- Clean and beginner-friendly interface
- Fast global DNS network
- No hidden limits for basic DNS usage

You can always switch to another provider later.

## Step 1: Create a Cloudflare Account

Go to Cloudflare and create an account:

👉 https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up

Use a real email address. You’ll need it to manage your DNS later.

## Step 2: Add Your Domain to Cloudflare

After logging in, click **Add a site** and enter your domain name.

Example:

```
example.dpdns.org
```

Select the **Free** plan when asked.

Cloudflare will automatically scan existing DNS records.
 If your domain is new, this list may be empty. That’s fine.

Continue to the next step.

## Step 3: Update Nameservers

Cloudflare will assign two nameservers to your domain, for example:

```
alice.ns.cloudflare.com
bob.ns.cloudflare.com
```

Go back to the **DigitalPlat dashboard**, open your domain settings, and replace the current nameservers with the Cloudflare ones.

Save the changes.

DNS propagation usually takes a few minutes, but in some cases it may take up to 24 hours.

## Step 4: Verify DNS Is Active

Once the nameservers are updated, Cloudflare will automatically detect the change.

You’ll see your domain status become **Active** in the Cloudflare dashboard.

At this point, Cloudflare is successfully hosting your DNS.

## Step 5: Manage DNS Records

In Cloudflare, open your domain and go to **DNS → Records**.

Here you can add records such as:

- **A / AAAA** for pointing to an IP address
- **CNAME** for linking to another domain
- **TXT** for verification or services

Changes usually take effect within seconds.

## Alternative DNS Providers

Cloudflare is recommended, but not required.

If you already use another DNS provider, DigitalPlat also works with:

- FreeDNS
- Hostry
- Any provider that supports custom nameservers

Advanced users can even run their own DNS servers.

## Next Step

Now that DNS hosting is set up, you’re ready to connect your domain and start using it with services.
